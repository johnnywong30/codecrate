## Summary
CodeCrate is a web app that will allow users to create a QR Code to represent a *box*. In such *box*, a user is able to add items to it to know exactly what a box contains. This can help alleviate confusion later when moving and trying to locate certain items, especially when it's been weeks since you've packed your items.
